## üß≠ Overview
InclusioMap BCN is a data-driven tool that aims to enhance educational inclusivity in Barcelona by utilizing open data. The project uses datasets that include information on educational centers, digital gaps, labor markets, and income distribution across different districts. By combining these datasets, the platform offers users insights into how different factors impact access to education and opportunities.

The backend is responsible for managing and processing data, while the frontend provides an interactive user interface to explore and visualize the data.
